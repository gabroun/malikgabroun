Recently, I have decided to rebuild my website to use ReactJS as I got interested in it. As a result, this is the first release of my website and going to improve it and add more features as I go along in improving my knowledge of React.

So, in this blog I will be writing posts that talk about topics such as ReactJS, GatsbyJs, GraphQL and any Frontend related topics that I take interest in.

In addition, I will be writing about some tips and perhaps tutorials that I find it useful to me in development which may and may not be useful to someone else.
