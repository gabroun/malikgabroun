                  <p>Hello, my name is Malik Elgabroun.</p>

                  <p>
                    Iâ€™m a Front end Developer based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Currently

                    I enjoy writing software and building application, and
                    currently I get to develop using React, Vue, TypeScript and
                    many more.

                  <p>
                    My hobbies are doing sports from playing football, running
                    and cycling. Also I like travelling to new places when the
                    opportunity arises.
